# simple_website_project

###### group_1

Welcome to our project GitHub! We are a group of EIT students developing an eCommerce website using Agile Methods for our course. The purpose of this project is to help us practice Agile methods by planning, testing and reviewing our prototype an iteration at a time. 

In our Project folder, we have supplied Iteration progress reports and meeting reports that detail the processes we undertook over the course of the project. You may also find personas which are curated people who would want to use our eCommerce website prototype. In our stakeholder register we have supplied the stakeholders of the group and listed their roles/interests towards the project. This is to let us know how involved everyone is in the project. A risk register was made during Iteration 3 and during this stage we analysed potential risks and our own plans to mitigate them. Also during Iteration 3 a User Acceptance Test was conducted to test how usable the eCommerce webiste was for users. This test will let us grasp an understanding of where the website is at and how it can be improved. Lastly our Resource Needs document details plans and the resources required to undertake them.
